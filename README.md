# Module-11-Challenge-BeautSoup Richard Soos Visual Data Boot Camp
# Web scraping for articles on the Planet Mars and analysing table data of its weather
# Part a uses BeautifulSoup within a Python Script to scrape article titles and preview 
# text of a Planet Mars Website. It presents a JSON extract file of the data we assemble 
# in a Pandas DataFrame.
# Part b uses the same technologies again to scrape data from a Planet Mars website table.
# I have provided the data in a csv file extract
# I made an estimate of the number of Earth Days that make a Mars day
# I modelled the yearly temperature cucle with a 'Sine Wave' and used its period.
